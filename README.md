# General

Commands used so to install packages:

```
npm install react
npm install react-dom
yarn add @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env -D
```

In the last command, -D is to set the dependencies as devDependencies.


# Converting with Babel in the terminal

Ads we installed **@babel/cli**, we can use the following command to convert our code in the terminal:

```
<application-root>/node_modules/bin/babel <input> <output>
```
